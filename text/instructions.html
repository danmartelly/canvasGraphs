<p>Hi my name is Daniel Martelly, one of your TAs in 6.01. My master's thesis will be about automatically grading graphing questions on online education systems. So, I've prepared these review questions below in an effort to try and help you prepare for the exam as well as gather real data on what students draw. On the axes below, you can draw graphs and save the plots. It takes some time to load (typically not more than 30 seconds) so please be patient. Please help me out by making an honest attempt on each problem <b>before you click "Show Answer"</b>. Please remember to submit the latest version of your answer before changing web pages. As a last note, any data I gather will be ANONYMIZED.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
