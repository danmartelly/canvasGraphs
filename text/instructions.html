<p>Hi my name is Daniel Martelly, one of your TAs in 6.01. My master's thesis will be about automatically grading graphing questions on online education systems. So, I've prepared these review questions below in an effort to try and help you prepare for the exam as well as gather real data on what students draw. If you would like to help me out, please make sure to submit your drawing before you click "Show Answer". A last note, any data I gather will be ANONYMIZED.</p>
