<h2>Revisiting Transition Models</h2>
<p>For this problem let's revisit the transition models in Design Lab 9 and figure out what the belief looks like as the number of transitions goes to infinity. For this question, do not focus on being precise when drawing the graphs. The point is to get an intuition as to which states have the highest probability associated with them and which ones have the lowest. First of all here's a reminder of what each of the transition models are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Teleport Model: The robot moves 1 state forward (to the right) with probability 0.7, and teleports to a random state (distributed uniformly) with probability 0.3.
    <li>Reset Model: The robot moves 1 state forward (to the right) with probability 0.7, and moves to state 0 with probability 0.3.
    <li>Teleport Model 2: The robot remains in its current state with probability 0.7, and teleports to a random state (distributed uniformly) with probability 0.3.
    <li>Reset Model 2: The robot remains in its current state with probability 0.7, and moves to state 0 with probability 0.3.
</ul>
<p>Assume that the belief state starts out in a uniform distribution and there are 9 states. Sketch how the belief state would look like as time goes to infinity i.e. after many transitions. No observations are made. When sketching, keep in mind that states are discrete. Again, do not worry about being precise.</p>
