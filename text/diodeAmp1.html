<h3>The Plot Thickens...</h3>
<p>(Adapted from Fall 2013 Midterm 2 question of same name)
Bored on a Friday night, Lem E. Tweakit decided it would be fun to experiment with the IR distance sensor he built in software lab. He generated plots by getting the robot to move at a constant velocity away from a light source with different circuit configurations. Unfortunately, soar crashed and he lost most of his plots before he could save them!
The only plot that he has left is from his initial set up. Below is a schematic of his setup and the plot he generated:</p>

<p>Help Lem remember the results of his experiment by plotting how the voltage changes over time for the following experimental conditions.
<br><b>Experiment 1:</b> Change the resistor R1 to be 250kOhms</p>
