<h2>2 Headed Coins</h2>
<p>Your friend offers you a quarter at random from the bag. He tells you he bought trick coins so that half the coins in the bag are double-headed. Rather than immediately inspect it to see which type you've received you decide to flip the coin a few times to see what you get. In the end, the coin flips you get are HHHHHTH. That is 5 heads in a row, a tails, and another heads. How does the belief state change with each coin flip? Plot the probability that the coin is a double-headed coin on each coin flip. The x axis is the flip number and the y axis is the probability of the coin being double headed. When sketching, keep in mind that the x-axis has discrete events.</p>
