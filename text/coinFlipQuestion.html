<h2>2 Headed Coins</h2>
<p>Your friend has just returned from shopping at a prank store. Among the stink bombs and whoopee cushions, he's bought several quarters which have heads on both sides of the coin. He's mixed it with change he got from the store so that there are an equal number of normal quarters (tails on one side, heads on the other) in the bag as well.</p>

<p>Your friend offers you a quarter at random from the bag. Rather than immediately inspect it to see which type you've received you decide to flip the coins few times to see what you get. In the end, the coin flips you get are HHHHHTH. That is 5 heads in a row, a tails, and another heads. How does the belief state change with each coin flip? Plot the probability that the coin is a double-headed coin on. The x axis is the flip number and the y axis is the probability of the coin being double headed. When drawing, keep in mind that the x-axis has discrete events.</p>
