<h3>Robot Vision</h3>
<p>(Adapted form Spring 2013 Midterm 2 question of same name.) The diagrams below illustrate the robot head that we used in a Design Lab with its two photosensors (left and right 'eyes'), and a circuit to convert the photodetector currents to voltages VL and VR.</p>
<img src="images/lightFollowerCircuit.png">
<p>The plot below shows the voltage difference VL-VR that is produced by a light that is one foot from the head, as a function of the angle &#952;l to the light relative to the angle &#952;h of the head.</p>

</p>On each reference graph below, sketch how the changes below would change the shape of the curve. When looking at the answers, please note that the answer is demonstrated by the dashed line.</p>
<p><b>Experiment 1</b>: Starting from the original configuration, R7 and R8 are changed to 30M&#937;.</p>
