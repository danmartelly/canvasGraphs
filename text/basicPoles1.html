<h3>Graphing poles</h3>
<p>For this question, we are going to practice drawing unit sample responses for simple block diagrams. Try to be precise when drawing. When you check your answer, make sure that the period you found is similar and that the response grows or shrinks at a similar rate.

First, let's start with the following block diagram which includes a gain with value G.</p>

<p>Draw the unit sample response if G=.95. Make sure to set the y-axis.</p>
